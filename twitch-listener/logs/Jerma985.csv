Went to Disney world with my special needs son who was 7 at the time. Sydney has a thing where they give out free fast passes to anyone with special needs. Problem was they only gave it to those who have special needs so when we wanted to ride a ride the adults would have to wait and but my 7 year old special needs kid could go on by themselves.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands",lazdona,"2022-11-05 14:08:23,032"

"jermaExplainingHow Jerma streams in 864p because the maximum bitrate allowed by twitch is 6000kbps. 1080p 60 is too large for that bitrate to look good. 864p was chosen as it is a slight bump in resolution over 720p while remaining a ""true 16x9"" resolution (divisible by 8).
